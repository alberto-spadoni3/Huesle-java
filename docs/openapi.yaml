  description:
    This API, titled "Huesle API", serves as the backend for the Huesle application.
    It provides a set of endpoints for managing user accounts, including registration, login, logout, and profile settings updates.
    It also includes endpoints for game management, such as searching for matches, joining private matches, leaving current matches, and making guesses in a match.
    Additionally, it provides endpoints for retrieving user statistics and match details.
    The API uses JWT for authentication.
